## Introduction

_This whitepaper describes the most important parts of Blocklancer. In this whitepaper the components of Blocklancer and the processes involved are described._

_The full pdf version of the whitepaper can be found [here](https://blocklancer.net/static/main/docs/lancer_whitepaper.pdf)._

The Blocklancer whitepaper will introduce and elaborate on the many features and novelties
the platform will introduce to the freelancing world.
The Blocklancer platform is intended as a means to revolutionize the process of freelancing
and improve the cooperation between the freelancer and the Client. It is going to solve many
issues involved in the Freelancing process, including but not limited to:

* refusals of payment for the agreed-on amount of money for a project,
* fake or undeserved reviews, and
* the uncontrollable influence and abuse of power of a central authority figure

## Distributed Autonomous Job Market

It is our belief that a completely self-regulatory system is the best solution for a Freelancer
platform such as Blocklancer. Therefore, we have created a new form of job market: The
Distributed Autonomous Job Market (DAJ for short).
DAJ is our vision of the job market of the future and our proposed solution for many of the
underlying problems currently faced by freelancing platforms. Most of the decisions made on
our platform are in the hands of the Tokenholders, which means that there won’t be one single
authoritarian instance with an uncontrollable amount of influence on the market. This
effectively puts the power in the hands of the Tokenholders, giving Freelancers and Clients a
fairer way to transact.
The Tokenholder Tribunal, which will be explained in detail further below, is one example of
a decentralized, self-regulatory system for settling disputes between Clients and Freelancers.

## The Lancer Token

A holder of the Lancer Token benefits from the Blocklancer platform in two ways.
* If you hold more than 10,000 Lancer Token you get access to premium features on the
Blocklancer platform. After holding more than 10,000 Lancer Tokens for a period of at
least 1 month your account will be automatically upgraded to a premium account.
* If you hold Lancer Tokens, you are allowed to participate in the Tokenholder Tribunal.
For participating in the Tokenholder Tribunal in an honest and informed way you will
be rewarded by a share of the platform fees.
The benefits of the premium account and the participation in the Tokenholder Tribunal will
be delineated in the following sections.

### Premium Accounts

Access to premium accounts is restricted to Tokenholders. Only Tokenholders, who hold more
than 10,000 Lancer Tokens, for a period longer than 1 month get access to premium features
of the platform.

This way we incentivize people, who are interested in the long-term success of Blocklancer.
People, who are holding Lancer Tokens purely for speculative reasons and short periods of
time, will not be able to use premium features.
With the success of the Blocklancer platform the demand for Lancer Tokens will increase, on
the other hand the supply for Lancer Tokens will decrease, because premium users will not
sell their Tokens, because they would lose access to the premium features.
The premium account includes features such as:
* Getting access to detailed profile statistics. Know, who viewed your profile and how
you can optimize your profile appearance.
* Only allow the best rated freelancers to apply for your jobs. Your job offers will be
predominantly visible to the best freelancers on the platform. Freelancers with no
rating or bad rating will not be allowed to apply for your jobs.
* Your job offers will be higher ranked by our search engine.
* Your application for a job offer will be ranked above non-premium applicants.
* Get early access to new features.

### Participate in the Tokenholder Tribunal

Every Tokenholder, who holds Lancer Tokens longer than 1 month, is allowed to participate in
the Tokenholder Tribunal. After the ICO, everyone who participated in the pre-sale or ICO is
able to participate in the Tokenholder Tribunal.
If you transfer the Lancer Tokens to another account the account will not be able to participate
in the Tokenholder Tribunal for 1 month. This way the system cannot be exploited by
transferring Lancer Tokens between multiple accounts. The share of the fees, the Tokenholder
will get after a cycle (~2 months) depends on the number of Tokens he holds and
predominantly on his activity in the Tokenholder Tribunal. This means that the Tokenholders
are rewarded for their efforts in the Tokenholder Tribunal. In contrast to this, passive
Tokenholders will not get any shares from distributed by our platform.

## The Token Holder Tribunal

The Tokenholder Tribunal is activated, if there is a dispute between client and freelancer. In
order to activate the Tokenholder Tribunal a small fee (\~50USD) has to be paid. This way we
make sure that the Tokenholder Tribunal is not abused.
Moreover, it is more attractive to activate our Tokenholder Tribunal compared to dispute
settlements of conventional freelancing websites. The fees of traditional freelancing platforms
regarding dispute settlements are far too high (\~$500 USD) for common disputes, which is
unreasonable for most jobs.
If the activation of the Tokenholder Tribunal would be free, a rational agent would always
choose to activate the Tokenholder Tribunal. Even if the agent knows that he has not fulfilled
the task, he will activate the Tokenholder Tribunal, because there is a very small probability
that the Tokenholder Tribunal decides that the agent is right. By introducing this small fee, we
are preventing these very agents from abusing the Tokenholder Tribunal system.

### Process

If the dispute is activated, Tokenholders are chosen randomly to participate in the dispute
settlement procedure. This makes sure that the Tokenholders cannot know a priori, in which
dispute settlements they will participate. The set of Tokenholders that are chosen to
participate in the Tokenholder Tribunal for a certain project will get all available information
about the project.
This includes:
* the complete job offers
* Information about the history of the freelancer and the client
* The final submission and earlier submissions of the freelancer.
Moreover, the client and the freelancer have the possibility to submit a statement for the
case. The Tokenholders have to study the material to make an informed decision. The decision
making is binary, so that the Tokenholders can decide either in favor of the client or of the
freelancer.


### Calculation of the votes

The Tokenholder Tribunal is open for a certain period of time (\~ 1 week) and the participating
Tokenholders are also able to change their decision during this period. During this period the
tally is not visible to the participating Tokenholders.
The Tokenholders can vote either in favor of the client or the freelancer. After this period, the
tally becomes visible to everyone and the final decision is made public.
The settlement is done by majority vote. If no majority is reached, the involved client and
freelancer have the possibility to activate another Tokenholder Tribunal.
If the Tokenholder belongs to the majority, his vote is counted as “positive vote”, whereas if
the Tokenholder belongs to the minority, his vote is counted as “negative vote”.

### Calculation of the distributed Fees

After every dispute each Tokenholder who participated in the dispute receives a so-called vote
share. The vote share is higher, the less Tokenholders take part in the dispute.
This incentivizes Tokenholders to cast their vote on more difficult disputes (e. g. cod is not
working properly), as this will lead to a greater share.
On the other hand, this will ensure that the easier cases are not overflown by votes, as the
share will increase substantially with the number of votes already cast.
Should the Tokenholders vote be counted as a “negative vote”, he loses double the vote share
of the respective dispute. This way we make sure that Tokenholders, who are not making
informed decisions are penalized. This mechanism grants that there is the highest incentive
for Tokenholders in finding reasonable decisions.
After a dispute cycle (\~2 months), the share of the Tokenholders is calculated in the following
way.
We calculate each Tokenholders share by multiplying the total amount of vote shares he
acquired in this period with the amount of Lancer Token he holds at the end of the period. We
denote the result by T.
10 | Page
Then we calculate the sum of all shares (from all Tokenholders during this cycle) we denote
the sum by W. Now the share of the Tokenholder is W/T.
This means if W = 100 and T = 10, the share of the Tokenholder would be 100/10 = 10%. So,
the Tokenholder would get 10% of the platform fees that were collected during this cycle.

###Common disputes

On current freelancing platforms ~90% of all disputes are very easy to settle. Common
dispute cases are for example:
* The freelancer disappears.
* The freelancer hadn't completed the project before a milestone/deadline.
* The client doesn't mark the job as completed. He just disappeared.
* Undeservedly bad review from client/freelancer.
* Freelancer isn't responding.
Such disputes are undoubtedly easy to rate for most people. Such situations are the most
perfect use cases for the Token Holder Tribunal. On current freelancing platforms you have
to pay high fees even for such easy dispute cases. Fees of up to $ 500 are simply not worth
this amount of money, as it is simpler and less expensive to hire another freelancer. 

### Expert Tribunal

Should the client or the freelancer not be satisfied with the decision of the Tokenholder
Tribunal, there is also the possibility to activate an Expert Tribunal. The fee for activating the
Expert Tribunal is about 500 USD. The Expert Tribunal is a board of experts. The decision of
the Expert Tribunal cancels out the decision of the Tokenholder Tribunal. This means that if
the Expert Tribunal comes to a different conclusion than the Tokenholder Tribunal, the
decision of the Expert Tribunal will be applied to the case.

### Double vote attacks

A major problem of all voting systems on the Blockchain so far are double voting attacks.
Anybody could just vote for someone and directly afterwards send the funds to another
Ethereum address and vote again.
Currently there are some implementations to tackle this. For example, the DAO prevented his
users from transferring tokens whilst a tally was in progress. This is of course no option for the
Blocklancer platform because then transfers wouldn’t be possible far too often.
To prevent such a behavior from Tokenholders everyone must own their Lancer token for a
period of at least 1 month. After receiving Lancer Tokens from another account, the receiving
account will not be able to participate in the Tokenholder Tribunal for 1 month. This way the
system cannot be exploited by transferring Lancer Tokens between multiple accounts.

### Scalability

Every token holder has a random value assigned to his account (range = 0 - 1000). This allows
us to only allow a specific group of Tokenholders to vote at a single dispute (e.g. numbers 200
- 300). One might question why that should be needed. Actually, it’s quite simple. It would
create a limit to the maximum number of disputes all the Tokenholders would be able to vote
for, should everyone always be able to vote on every dispute. Put simply, this allows us to
distribute all disputes evenly among all Tokenholders and thus allowing for an unlimited
scalability. More job offers would mean a higher demand for Lancer Token and thus increasing
the diversity of Tokenholders. Those could be evenly split among the higher number of
disputes by automatically shrinking the vote groups (e.g. numbers 100 - 150).

### Self-vote protection

Another major problem of current voting implementations is that Tokenholders would always
be able to vote for themselves. Tokenholders aren’t allowed to vote for themselves. But a
clever Tokenholder would now just transfer his tokens to another account and thus
circumvent the protection, even though he would lose some credibility and all premium
features on his main account. The implemented voter groups are applicable here as
well. The Tokenholder just wouldn’t be ensured to be able to vote on a dispute he himself is
involved in. This ensures that there won’t be any planned malicious actions regarding selfvotes.

### Majority Overtaking

Should there be a Tokenholder in a voter group with substantially more tokens than the rest,
he would be able to dominate or even overtake that voter group. To tackle, this every vote
has the same impact on the final decision, independent from the number of tokens one holds.
The minimum amount to be able to vote in the Tokenholder Tribunal is 5000 LNC. To ensure
that nobody is able to just split up his Lancer over multiple accounts we are implementing an
ID verification process.

### The Tokenholder Tribunal as a Game

The Tokenholders have a separate voting platform with a ranking system which ranks them by
the amount of vote shares they have. This ensures a higher motivation of voting correct in the
Token Holder Tribunal by granting them the incentive of social recognition. The Tokenholders
will be able to reach higher levels on the platform by gaining more vote shares or badges. The
Badge achievementsystem will be similar to those on many forums today (e.g. Stackoverflow).
Where the Tokenholders receive badges for certain achievements (e.g. first vote, ten
consecutive correct votes).

### Can I lose anything

You can’t have less than zero vote shares and thus you can’t lose anything by voting. With that
we mean you can lose neither Ether nor Lancer. By voting on disputes you can only receive, in
exchange for the time you invested in making an educated and informed vote, a share of the
platform fees.

### Know Your Customer

Many transactional applications require up-front knowledge concerning certain aspects of a
counterparty's identity.
In many respects, the Blockchain is no different and legal entities who have a beneficial
relationship with Blockchain-logic may also have the need for ensuring the Blockchain logic
itself ascertains this kind of knowledge before engaging in a transactional relationship.

### Preventing wrong voting

To prevent Tokenholders from voting wrong on purpose in the Token Holder Tribunal (e. g.
voting in favor of their colleague) we created an environment to highly discourage such
actions. If a Tokenholder has zero vote shares his votes will not count towards the end result
of the dispute but he still receives vote shares for his vote. This ensures that he needs correct
votes to change anything in the end results of disputes. On top of that we have algorithms in
place to detect and ban users that obviously try to harm the platform. With those levels of
security in place it practically becomes impossible to cast several malicious votes and thus, the
Token Holder tribunal has the highest possible chance of finding a correct decision.

## Ratings and Reviews

Freelancers and clients are able to provide feedback on each other and help others to decide
which freelancers or clients to choose.

### Overview

Freelancers or clients are able to rate each other on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. They can also choose
to add a written review, which is optional. Every user has a summary rating which is always
displayed alongside the username. Freelancers also have a separate rating for each skill (e.g.
C++, Translation …) which allows a potential client to determine the skills of the freelancers in
question in more detail, making the process of finding the correct freelancer far easier.

### Process

Freelancers or clients are able to rate each other after a job is completed. This minimizes the
risk of people rating each other without prior knowledge of each other’s skills. After the job is
completed the freelancer and the client have 2 days to rate each other. After this period, both
ratings become public. This ensures that nobody is making ratings just as revenge. If a negative
rating of the client/freelancer would instantly get public the other party could just make a bad
counter review as “revenge” and thus rendering the whole rating process pointless, because
there wouldn’t be a benefit in rating anybody bad, you would just lose by doing so. After the
rating process is completed the new rating gets added to the summary rating.

### Reviews

Both freelancer and client have the option to leave a written review which is shown in each
other’s profile. It is highly encouraged to leave a written review because it is far more
meaningful than just a simple rating.

### Disputing unjustified ratings
Should the freelancer or the client not being satisfied with their rating, they have the option
to dispute the rating. The Tokenholders are then tasked to review the whole job to determine 
if the rating is justified or not. Should the Tokenholders come to the conclusion that the rating
isn’t justified, the rating/review gets removed from the client’s or freelancer’s profile. This
way, Blocklancer ensures that ratings aren’t final like on current freelancing platforms, we
provide this option because freelancers or clients could lose much income by unjustified
ratings.

### Skill ratings

Freelancers also have a separate skill rating for every skill individually, because an overall
rating wouldn’t tell much about the freelancer’s capabilities in certain skills. The skill rating is
calculated the same way as the overall rating with the only difference being that a new rating
only gets added to the skill if the skill was part of the job.

### Fake reviews
There are always people which try to push their ratings to make deceitful actions. Blocklancer
has multiple features in place to prevent such actions.
* Reviews are only creatable after a successfully finished job. This ensures that nobody
is able to just spam fake ratings on their friends profiles because they would need to
pay the minimum amount (0.01 ETH) for every review they add this way. This ensures
that such ratings aren’t really economically interesting in the first place.
* Should a user’s work quality suddenly decrease after several years, he would still have
a great rating for several more. In order to solve this problem, newer ratings will have
a greater impact on the overall rating, thus rendering this issue non-existent.

## Actions in a job

Both freelancers and clients have the option to perform certain actions in a job. To make this
section clearer, we split the actions up into freelancer actions and client actions.

### Client Actions
* Pick a freelancer: After freelancers made their bids, the client is able to select a
freelancer to complete the job. The client needs to have the funds to be able to pay
the selected freelancer before selecting this freelancer. After selecting a freelancer,
the client isn’t able to withdraw those funds before completing the job.
* Cancel a job: If the client hasn’t yet chosen a freelancer he is able to cancel the whole
job. After this action is performed neither a freelancer is able to bid for this job nor is
anyone able to see this job anymore.
* Complete a job: After the freelancer finished the job, the client is able to complete the
job. After this action is performed the freelancer instantly receives his payment. The
client also has the option to give a rating to the freelancer when completing the job
but the written review is optional and can be left blank.
* Call the Tokenholder Tribunal: The client is able to call the Tokenholder Tribunal
should he not be satisfied with the work of the freelancer (see 6.).

### Freelancer Actions

* Bid for a job: The freelancer is able to bid for any job he would like to make. The bids
are limited to 10 bids per week. This ensures that a freelancer isn’t just making a bid
for every job that is posted, but only for those he is really interested in.
* Cancel the job: If the freelancer isn’t able to complete a job he can choose to cancel
the job. After he canceled the job the client’s funds are instantly unlocked and he is
able to withdraw them.
* Rate the client: If the client marked the job as completed the freelancer is able to rate
the client.
* Call the Tokenholder Tribunal: The freelancer is able to call the Tokenholder Tribunal
should the client refuse to mark the job as completed (e.g. the client disappeared).

## User Profile

The user profile is a collection of settings and information associated with a certain user. The user
profile is the main page after clicking on anyone’s username on any site within the Blocklancer
platform. It contains all the major information about a certain user such as:

* Username: The username a user chose when registering on the platform. It is always visible
when the user is displayed throughout the platform.
* Short Description: A short description of the user (< 100 words).
* Description: The full description of the user.
* Skills: The skills the user has, including the rating for each skill.
* Reviews: Reviews the user received from other users he worked with.
* Education: Educations are Schools, Courses or Degrees a user has completed.
* Experience: Experiences are prior Jobs or projects a user worked on in the past.
* Lost Disputes: The total amount of lost dispute cases.
* Won Disputes: The total amount of won dispute cases.
* Total Disputes: The total amount of dispute cases.
* Profile image: The profile square sized image of the user.
* Rating: The overall rating of the user.
